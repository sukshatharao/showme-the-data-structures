union & intersection of the two linked list is the problem statement. I have used a set inorder to store the result of union and intersection. Then I created a new linked list from the set.

Union: Time complexity: O(n) , Space complexity: O(n)

intersection: Time complexity: O(n) , Space complexity: O(n)
