I have created linked list inorder to create blocks. I have initialized the linked list with head and tail and Head points to the starting of the chain. tail points to the end of linked list. Appending the new block to the linked list is done at the end of the tail in O(1) complexity


Space complexity: O(n) - total space occupied by the blockchain 
Time complexity: O(1) - for appending a node/block
